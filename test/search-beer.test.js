    description: 'We\'ve been loving creating Collaboration beers with great creative brewers from all over the world these last several years-unique beers that would never have existed without the free-flowing imagination and idea generation of the collaborative process. However, when it comes to the Stone Anniversary Ales, it\'s all us. Yet, it is indeed still a collaboration with great creative brewers (if we do say so ourselves). We\'re talking about our own brewing team, of course. And while some of our beers, anniversary and otherwise, have been designed by a single person, the Stone 16th Anniversary IPA was definitely a team effort.\r\n\r\nThis year our brewing team was inspired by some exotic-ish additions of the lemony persuasion. Yes, it\'s a Double IPA (can you really say you\'re surprised?), but as we strive to do with all our Stone Anniversary Ales of the let\'s-take-this-IPA-in-a-new-direction variety, we\'ve brewed up a Stone-worthy divergence from tradition. The amount of rye malt we used isn\'t quite enough to warrant the appellation "Rye IPA," but it still adds hints of spiciness that contrast deliciously with the tropical fruit flavors and aromas of the Amarillo and Calypso hops. Add a few European specialty malts, some lemon verbena, and three more hop varieties to the mix, and you have a highly complex brew melding both bitter and fruity hop notes with rich toasted malt character punctuated by nuances of spicy rye and subtle lemon.',

    description: 'Stone 10th Anniversary IPA harkens back to our earlier Anniversary Ales, with abundant hopping at many stages of the brewing process. Appropriately, the aroma is over-the-top, with pronounced piney and resiny hop flavors combined with tropical fruit esters and more subtle notes of toasted malts and alcohol. Our Stone 10th Anniversary Ale weighs in at 10% alcohol by volume (perfect for a 10th anniversary beer), and has a little more color and malt character than our other IPAs. In addition to using the new Summit hop variety in the brewhouse to provide the powerful bitterness, we went back through our records and found some of our favorite hops over the years, and used them to flavor this brew, including Chinook, Crystal, and large doses of Simcoe in the dry-hop to provide a huge, complex, piney, fruity and floral hop character. This is a colossal beer, big in every sense: hoppy, malty, rich, and strong! Right up our alley.',

It\'s a truly unique and distinctive IPA that is brewed with malted wheat, experimental hops and elderflower. The use of wheat enhances the complex hop profile. Two experimental hop varieties - Jarrylo and Belma - contribute fruity hop flavors that resemble blackberry and strawberry, while mellow floral notes of elderflower cover the palate. The finish is hop bitter as you would expect from an IPA.\r\n\r\nFor our annual collaboration beer, we teamed up with our longtime friends at Stone Brewing Co. - craft brewing pioneers known for their love of hops who, like BJ\'s, got their start brewing beer in Southern California in 1996. Together we decided to brew a wheat IPA with a unique hop profile.',
